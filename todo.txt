I will host this by the end of Dec

Generally there are two servers onr for the front-end and one for the backend. 
Both will interact with each other. In our synario we will be creating two servers. The front end server will be the sap ui5 server, but all the server file serving would be done by the exprees. and the backend server will be an express server.

So lets start and and go on and work on the project.

data processing -> server

* Backend server side where all the user activities.
* React Server where all the web application ui will be there.
* UI5 Side where we will be using our main application.

Target to host will be 1st january.

three servers :
react server -> front server
backend server -> server having connection with db.
ui5 server -> armcharts and data processing will occur here.

Note that if we add subscription, only one device at a time even logged in can 

add user table having columns

User info table
islogin, distinguish based on ip address(P), primary key from the userInfo table, isSubscribed, subscription id.

session table:
session start time, session end time, playing duration, no. of generate hit, chart type, upload data size[], no. of uppload, no of downloads, download type[].

subscription table.
username, country, city, 

Initially every thing will be free.
